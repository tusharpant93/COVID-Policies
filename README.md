Your client is concerned with interactions on social media related to civil unrest and political protesting in order to help identify themes that can inform improved policing and policies.  Historically the client would directly interview protesters, asking for social media handles directly.  After which the organization would research the posts of the individuals looking for qualitative insights related to their research.  Since not all user posts are relevant, the research required time intensive manual labeling of social media posts from a particular user.  The labels would be related to civil, political discourse or not.  Below is a labeled example from a twitter user.

Technical:
•	Provide some insights such as frequent words, averages and other EDA about documents etc.
•	Create a document classification model to identify political discourse documents
•	Calculate the Accuracy of the model for a training and validation set.
